#Assignment: Reflection One
*Brief responses are just fine.*

1. List at least 5 examples of institutional racism. Try to come up with these independently, but use google if needed.
- Hiring - difference in reaction based on name, interview, assumptions in hiring committee that lead to disfavoring an individual
- Language in a space being accepted that is racist and not addressed
- Policing - arresting people based on race
- Making communities that are geared toward a certain race - #blacklivesmatter in Toronto with the LGBTQ+ group
- oscar picks and #oscarssowhite - films and actors not being chosen due to race

1. What, if anything, was a new concept to you in this section? Does this raise any further questions for you?
- specific vs. general examples - institutional racism exists in both.
